If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or charges for other services indicated on any Form referencing these Terms within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is due or delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of such Service by You, Agents and End-Users.</div>
    <div class="tos_paragraph">7.2 If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use the Service during Your Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of Your then current Subscription Term, charged to Your Account and due and payable upon implementation of such Subscription Upgrade. In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such Subscription Upgrades.</div>
    <div class="tos_paragraph">7.3 No refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You if You elect to downgrade Your Service Plan. Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and the SmileyGo does not accept any liability for such loss.</div>
    <div class="tos_paragraph">7.4 Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”).

    <div class="tos_paragraph">7.5 If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Service provides an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g. upon card renewal). The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each receipt of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Service to track subscription status.

In addition, to the extent that You have or are required to prepay for expected usage of SmileyGo Voice, Your credit balance will automatically be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when You first establish a prepaid credit for SmileyGo Voice, or by such additional amount You request as a regular prepaid credit. If applicable, You hereby authorize SmileyGo and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish such prepaid credit. You agree to promptly update your Account information with any changes (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. The Payment Agent uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for the Payment Agent.</div>
